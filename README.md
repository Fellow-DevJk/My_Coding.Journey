# My_Coding.Journey
This is a repository where I share my coding problems which I got stuck one but eventually overcame, also I share some Data structures and algorithms which I learned in my journey and I think beginners can find this repository helpful.
I hope to increase the difficulties of the problems and also try to post easier to understand solutions I can.

## Currently this repository contains

**[Linked List programs using C language](https://github.com/Fellow-DevJk/My_Coding.Journey/tree/main/creating%20Linked%20Lists%20using%20C)**

**[CPU scheduling algorithms implementation using C language](https://github.com/Fellow-DevJk/My_Coding.Journey/tree/main/CPU%20Scheduling%20Algorithms%20using%20C)**

**[Greedy approach algorithms using C language](https://github.com/Fellow-DevJk/My_Coding.Journey/tree/main/Greedy%20Approach%20Algorithms%20using%20C)**
